# TF2CDownloader
Simple script for downloading and extracting TF2Classic quickly, simply, and efficiently.

Requires no third-party libraries except for Rich. If you want to compile, you'll need to install python3-rich on Debian/Ubuntu, or get it through PIP on Windows.

In the Binaries folder of the repository, Aria2 and its relevant dependencies are extracted from: https://github.com/q3aql/aria2-static-builds (aria2-1.36.0-win-64bit-build2.7z)

Arc is extracted from https://github.com/mholt/archiver/releases/download/v3.5.0/arc_3.5.0_windows_amd64.exe

The contents of this folder can be freely replaced with your own builds of these tools, as long as aria2c.exe and pzstd.exe are present.
